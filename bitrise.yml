          To prevent step testing issues, like referencing relative
          files with just './some-file' in the step's code, which would
          work for testing the step from this directory directly
          but would break if the step is included in another `bitrise.yml`.

          The example input has a default value,
          you can overwrite it if you want to, just like we did below,
          but the step would use the default value specified in the `step.yml`
          file if you would not specify another value.
